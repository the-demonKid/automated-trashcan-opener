This automated trashcan uses a servo motor which is activated when the sonic senors are detected. The servo is delayed by 6 seconds when triggered so the user does not have to be constantly infront of the senors for the lid to be open.

Future Imporvements

Instead of attaching the servo motor to the box, the motor should be seperate from the can that holds the trash. Since the motor is inside the trashcan, the motors movement is often blocked by the trash inside. To fix this make an automated lid that has its own department for the electronics and use a heavier material so a coin weight is not needed to be used to reset the lid to a closed position.
